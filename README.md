# Emotion-Classification
Using NLTK, SKlearn, NumPy, pandas and matplotlib, this project is developed to classify emotions and the sentiment behind any given text. It leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning using libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify emotions in text data through efficient preprocessing and machine learning models. The dataset undergoes cleaning, preprocessing, and tokenization, followed by model training to achieve accurate classification.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
* Removing special characters, stop words, and irrelevant data.
* Tokenization using NLTK.
* Lemmatization (better performance compared to stemming).
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Insightful visualization of dataset distribution and trends.
## Machine Learning Models:
* Naive Bayes Classifier for a quick baseline.
* Logistic Regression for robust classification performance.

# Technologies Used
* NLTK:
  -Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword removal.
  -Used for text preprocessing and preparation.
* Scikit-learn:
  -Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization.
  -Building and evaluating classification models like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

## **Workflow**
1. **Data Loading**:
   - The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and exploration.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the text data by removing special characters, stop words, and irrelevant information.
   - Tokenized the text using **NLTK** to split it into individual words.
   - Applied **lemmatization** to normalize words by reducing them to their base forms.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transformed text data into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**, enabling it to be used in machine learning models.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained two machine learning models:
     - **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Established a baseline for emotion classification.
     - **Logistic Regression**: Used for more robust classification performance.
   - Compared model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the models on a test dataset and visualized performance metrics to analyze their effectiveness.
